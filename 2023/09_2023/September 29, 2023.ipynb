    "As we can see we are are currently trading at the high end of the 4 day trading range. And we would be very surprised we just break though the high of this 15030 (but we should be prepared for that possibility). A more likely scenario could be that we see a formation of a balance are between 15030 and 14850 (1.3% - 1.5% range). This will be consistent with formation of a Cup and Handle which we have historically seen as a formation at the major reversals.\n",
