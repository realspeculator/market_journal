    "- Yesterday we attempted to go long on the breakout of the 4277 pivot point on the S&P 500, but the market kept pulling lower and value was getting created in Oct 3rd day range.\n",
    "- So we took a 5 point loss and closed the trade around 2pm.\n",
    "- However the S&P 500 rallied into close and we traded above the 4300 level.\n",
    "- 4300 is now the new resistance level and we wanted to see how markets react at this.\n",
    "- The initial reaction to 4300 is selloff of 17 handles.\n",
    "- Now we are trying to find balance between the 4275 - 4300 level on the ES\n",
    "- TICK are remaining in the positive territory , the are not high (+1000) nor low (-1000). Just close to 0, so is the AD line and AD Vol\n",
    "- We will still monitor the cup and handle formation that we are seeing in the SPY and observe if we see any progress.\n",
