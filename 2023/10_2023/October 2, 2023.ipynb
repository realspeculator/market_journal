    "The second half of September 2023 saw stocks fall sharply and this fall was about 7%. Going into the last week there were worries that the US government will not be able to fund itself. But as usual during the 11th hour negotitations there was a temporary measure passed which will keep the government funded for the next 45 days. So essentially they kicked the can down the lane."

    "But when it comes to the major indices instead of seeing buyer step into take advantage of this selloff, we are seeing further weakness and a potential to break some key support at pivotal points. As we can see, we are putting on a revesal pattern as seen in the inverted cup and handle on the S&P 500 E-mini futures. We are also seeing a small balance area between ~4360 to ~4275. In the next image we will zoom in on that this balance area on a 30 mins chart."

    "As we zoom in the balance area mentioned above, we are seeing that prices are getting accepted at this level. Which does indicate that we are seeing any buyers. The market will be opening in about 23 mins and although we are bearish, within this range we could see huge volatility. One needs to sit tight and observe how prices react at the extremes of these two pivot points (~4360 to ~4280"
